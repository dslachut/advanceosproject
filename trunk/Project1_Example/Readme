Hello!!
This example shows: 
->how to spawn processes in two VMs 
->how to exchange messages between processes

We implement a simple task, find the maximum in a big file using erlang, in two virtual machine, and using gossip protocol(?).

I tried to provide you with enough comments in the code.I used full view instead of partial view. I hope this code to help you!!

Instructions:
-> Put the modules in the right path in your machine
1. Open both VMs.
2. Create a network between them (like we did for project_0).
3. Assign in one of them ip = 192.168.0.102 (Like we did for project_0-VM2).
4. Open the terminal in VM2 and write:
$erl -name slave@192.168.0.102 -setcookie 'password'(assuming that you already install erlang in VM2).
5. Open the terminal in VM1 and write: $erl (assuming that you already install erlang in VM1).
6. Compile the modules:
c(generate_big_file).
c(readBigFile).
.
.
.
c(g_main).
7. Generate your file :
generate_big_file:generate(File,size,range).
8. Run the code:
g_main:main(File).


I hope this example to helps you!!

Good Luck!
Nikos. ;)
